A proper understanding of these limitations will help you determine whether or not a different platform is going to serve you better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a more detailed look at some of the main reasons businesses look to move away from Shopify:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Excessive Transaction Fees</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the major drawbacks of the platform’s offerings, Shopify transaction fees, depending on your arrangement, range between 0.5% and 2% of every sale made, save for using Shopify Payments. Most Shopify alternatives, on the other hand, have little to no transaction costs, which would be rather significant, particularly for high-volume sellers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Limited Customization&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shopify provides a range of themes and apps, but the customisation options can be limiting. While themes are editable and applications can be used to extend more functionalities, many times, this isn’t the answer for everything you want to customize for a better customer experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Expensive Scalability&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There could be potential for finding that the costs of working with Shopify are quite ballooning when a business grows. The advanced features in higher-level plans are available at an extra price for a growing business, which can be pretty expensive in the long run. Some alternatives are able to provide more cost-effective scalability through advanced features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these limitations can lead businesses to look for Shopify alternatives that are more flexible, have better pricing structures, or have specific functionality that Shopify doesn’t offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Alternatives to Shopify: Complete Comparison</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Shopify</th><th>Magento</th><th>WooCommerce</th><th>BigCommerce</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Pricing</strong></td><td>Starts at $39/month</td><td>Open-source (Free) / Commerce edition</td><td>Below $10/month for Starters</td><td>Starts at $29/month</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Transaction Fees</strong></td><td>0.5% – 2%</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Customization</strong></td><td>Moderate</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>Moderate</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Scalability</strong></td><td>High</td><td>Very High</td><td>High</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ease of Use</strong></td><td>High</td><td>Moderate</td><td>Moderate</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td><strong>SEO Capabilities</strong></td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td><strong>App/Plugin Ecosystem</strong></td><td>Extensive</td><td>Extensive</td><td>Extensive</td><td>Moderate</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Multi-language Support</strong></td><td>Limited</td><td>Extensive</td><td>Extensive</td><td>Extensive</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Payment Gateways</strong></td><td>100+</td><td>150+</td><td>100+</td><td>65+</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3 Best Alternatives to Shopify in 2024</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are many Shopify alternatives in the market, these three platforms stand out for their robust features, flexibility, and scalability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1.
