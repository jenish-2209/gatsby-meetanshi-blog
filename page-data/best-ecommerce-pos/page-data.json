In fact, customers who shop across multiple channels have an estimated&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/blog/o2o-online-to-offline-commerce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><u><strong>33% higher lifetime value</strong></u></a>&nbsp;than single-channel shoppers.

This analysis will probe into the&nbsp;<strong>top 4 eCommerce POS systems</strong>&nbsp;that effectively link online and offline stores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is eCommerce POS Integration?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>eCommerce POS integration is the digital solution providing smoother data flow between POS software and other eCommerce platforms. This system enables companies&nbsp;<strong>to integrate offline and online channels into a retail ecosystem cohesively.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1542\" height=\"834\" src=\"https://5d43103688.nxcli.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ecommerce-pos.png\" alt=\"ecommerce pos\" class=\"wp-image-55281\" srcset=\"https://5d43103688.nxcli.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ecommerce-pos.png 1542w, https://5d43103688.nxcli.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ecommerce-pos-250x135.png 250w, https://5d43103688.nxcli.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ecommerce-pos-700x379.png 700w, https://5d43103688.nxcli.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ecommerce-pos-768x415.png 768w, https://5d43103688.nxcli.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ecommerce-pos-1536x831.png 1536w, https://5d43103688.nxcli.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ecommerce-pos-403x218.png 403w, https://5d43103688.nxcli.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ecommerce-pos-964x521.png 964w, https://5d43103688.nxcli.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ecommerce-pos-120x65.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1542px) 100vw, 1542px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The main key benefit of this integration lies in its ability to&nbsp;<strong>unify business operations</strong>. Therefore, retailers can manage their inventory, raise prices, lower them, and even holistically take orders, regardless of whether the transaction occurs in-store or online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the consolidated data and insights from eCommerce POS integration will deliver business owners and managers the clear visibility they need to make smart decisions across their entire retail operation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That sort of perspective — heavy with a bird’s eye view — holds immense value when it comes to strategic planning, inventory management, and spotting growth opportunities in both the physical and digital channels.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7 Benefits of Integration POS and eCommerce Platform</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For multi-channel selling retailers, POS integration with eCommerce is paramount. This solution is core and most important to two business types:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Businesses having only offline stores</strong>: These businesses are looking to scale their operations online and need a trustworthy eCommerce platform to help them develop their online presence.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Businesses having offline and online stores</strong>: Until now, these businesses have managed their offline and online stores independently. They often rely on manual data entry, which leads to inefficiencies and errors. That’s why these merchants are looking for a POS solution that seamlessly merges both channels to manage all data in a single place.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where both groups can turn to great use with the help of POS and eCommerce integration. Here are the&nbsp;<strong>seven&nbsp;key benefits</strong>&nbsp;of POS system for eCommerce platforms:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Sell Everywhere at Once</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As your business grows, you’ll want to sell through more channels — whether it’s adding a new online store, selling through 3rd-party marketplaces (eBay, Amazon,…), or opening another physical location.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With POS integration, managing these multiple sales channels becomes simple and centralized. Moreover, You can quickly add a new sales channel through a POS integration API. From then on, merchants can easily track sales, inventory, and customer data, no matter how many places they’re selling from.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Smoothly Handle Orders from Every Channel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Today’s customers want speed and reliability when filling orders. With every one of your stores treated as a fulfillment center, integrating your POS with your eCommerce platform guarantees you can process orders quickly and accurately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether they pick up in-store or have their orders shipped, you will be delivering seamless, hassle-free experiences one after another.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Say Goodbye to Manual Data Entry</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Manual data entry is a pain. It’s slow, error-prone, and sucks up so much of your time. However, with an eCommerce POS system, you manage everything from inventory to customer orders in one place, and the information is synchronized automatically across online and offline channels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No more manual updating again, no errors — just continuous automated processes that free you up to focus on more important things.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Keep an Eye on Stock and Avoid Over-Selling</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing what you have in stock at all times is crucial. With&nbsp;<strong>real-time inventory tracking</strong>&nbsp;through POS integration, you can see what’s selling and not across all your sales channels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This helps you avoid running out of popular items and getting stuck with products that aren’t moving. You’ll always be ready to meet customer demand and keep your shelves stocked with the right products.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Run Promotions and Discounts Across All Channels</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting up discounts and promotions can be a hassle, especially when applying them online and in-store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the moment you have eCommerce POS in hand, business owners can create and manage promotions across all channels with just a few clicks. Be it a store-wide sale or a special offer for online shoppers, you can keep your marketing efforts consistent and efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Get to Know Your Customers Better</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know that understanding your customers is the key to business growth. The point-of-sale integration with the eCommerce platform gives you a complete view of customer behavior on each channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that, these insights help provide personalized marketing efforts and drive wiser decisions in retaining those customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Make Shopping a Breeze for Your Customers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers today expect flexibility. They want to shop online, pick up in-store, or return items in any way that suits them. With a POS system integrated with your eCommerce platform, you can offer these seamless experiences effortlessly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, you’ll have all their shopping data in one place. Hence, eCommerce POS allows you to personalize promotions and build stronger customer relationships.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to integrate POS with an eCommerce Platform</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two most common ways of POS integration with an eCommerce platform:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Method #1: Standalone POS Integration</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, you will use the POS as a standalone system that allows integration with various eCommerce sites. For example, you are working as a merchant on multiple sites, like Shopify and WooCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the standalone POS can integrate with all of those independently, it will let you connect your independent POS to each one. Yet, this approach may involve additional costs of integration services or third-party solutions that tie everything together.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Method #2: Inbuilt with POS Integration</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some POS systems are natively developed to integrate with many eCommerce platforms out of the box. For example, <a href=\"https://www.magestore.com/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.magestore.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Magento POS by Magestore</a> is native to Magento, meaning it is built specifically for that platform and doesn’t require additional integration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, Shopify POS by Magestore is also natively integrated with Shopify, whereby once set up, everything comes along perfectly without any extra effort in integration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These solutions are “native” to their respective platforms, which means they work seamlessly with the eCommerce system right out of the box. The significant advantage is that no additional integration services are needed. Everything fits together smoothly, which can help reduce overall costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4 Best eCommerce Integration Solutions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The right POS system to integrate with an eCommerce platform will help smooth operations and provide a fantastic experience for customers. Next, we will discuss the four best eCommerce pos system solutions, highlighting varying strengths and considerations to consider in every case.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Magestore POS: Ideal for Magento and Shopify Merchants</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.magestore.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><u><strong>Magestore POS</strong></u></a>&nbsp;is developed explicitly for businesses using Magento and Shopify, so there won’t be any integration problems. This native compatibility means it&nbsp;<strong>doesn’t require additional tools or third-party services.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides, the built-in compatibility ensures everything works together from the start, smoothing the setup process and reducing the need for extra resources.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://meetanshi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Magstore-POS-Ideal-for-Magento-and-Shopify-Merchants.png\" alt=\"Magestore POS Ideal for Magento and Shopify Merchants\" class=\"wp-image-36895\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As a result, the system translates to a&nbsp;<strong>much easier setup&nbsp;</strong>than integrating other POS for Magento and POS for Shopify merchants. In terms of smartness and cost-effectiveness, having Magestore eCommerce POS ready when you are makes sense. It’s ideal for those looking to keep things simple while maintaining a seamless connection between their online and offline sales channels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key features:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Sync all data in real-time across locations and sales channels</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Accept various payment methods, including cash, cards, split payments, “buy now, pay later,” and reward points</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Easily connect with payment providers like Authorize.net, Stripe, Tyro, PayPal, and more</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Speed up checkout to reduce customer wait times</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offer self-checkout services and customer-facing displays for faster transactions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Handle refunds, returns, and exchanges smoothly</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Track inventory across all locations and transfer stock quickly from one dashboard</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sell seamlessly across multiple channels and marketplaces with omnichannel fulfillment options</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enable loyalty programs like reward points, store credits, and gift cards across all channels</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Get live, accurate reports for data-driven decisions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Operate smoothly whether online or offline — no internet required</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Customize and scale features to meet your unique business needs</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transaction fees:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>0% per sale</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Square POS: Best for Startups and Small Businesses</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Startups and small businesses prefer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://squareup.com/us/en/point-of-sale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><u><strong>Square POS</strong></u></a>&nbsp;because it is an all-rounder, easy to operate, and affordable. One of its unskippable features is Square Online, which helps companies quickly build online stores. This sets it aside as a great choice for new businesses to establish an online presence quickly.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://meetanshi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SquarePOS-Best-for-Startups-and-Small-Businesses.png\" alt=\"Square POS: Best for Startups and Small Businesses\" class=\"wp-image-36895\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Still, if you already have a website running, integrating with Square POS requires third-party services, such as Magento, Shopify, and WooCommerce. Of course, those extra services come at additional fees, and the integration won’t be as safe as native solutions allow. In addition, while Square POS has good functionality, its support and synchronizing capabilities are still limited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key features:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Accept online orders for in-store or curbside pickup</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offer a variety of payment options like cash, contactless, chip, Cash App, buy now pay later, cards on file, gift cards, and checks</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Quickly process refunds and automatically update stock levels</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Upload unlimited items to your inventory</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Track inventory in real-time across all your locations and online stores</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Set up alerts for low-stock items</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Access inventory reports and forecasts to stay ahead</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Automatically create customer profiles, groups, and custom fields with every plan</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Get unlimited personal passcodes, time tracking, timecard reporting, and multiple wage rates</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Advanced Access offers customizable permission sets starting at $35/month</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transaction fees:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>In-person transactions</strong>: 2.6% + 10¢ per sale</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Online transactions</strong>: 2.9% + 30¢ per sale</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Manually keyed transactions:</strong>&nbsp;3.5% + 15¢ per sale</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Invoices</strong>: 3.3% + 30¢ per sale</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Lightspeed POS: Best Flexible Standalone POS for eCommerce</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another standalone solution is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lightspeedhq.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><u><strong>Lightspeed POS</strong></u></a>. This eCommerce POS works with nearly every eCommerce platform out there, which gives great flexibility to companies with diverse needs. Whether using Magento, Shopify, or WooCommerce, merchants can integrate it with their eCommerce platform through Lightspeed’s services or by purchasing a third-party connector.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://meetanshi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Lightspeed-POS-Best-Flexible-Standalone-POS-for-eCommerce.png\" alt=\"Lightspeed POS: Best Flexible Standalone POS for eCommerce\" class=\"wp-image-36895\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>However, there are some drawbacks to this flexibility. Lightspeed POS integration can be expensive, especially when third-party services are required.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to Square, Lightspeed offers its website builder, Lightspeed eCom. While pricier than Square, it provides a more comprehensive, holistic solution. Businesses with existing websites might find that native solutions offer better synchronization and support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key features:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Connect with payment gateways like Authorize.net and PayPal</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Easily add and move stock between stores</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sync price adjustments and automatically reorder inventory</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Set up recurring transactions and automatic billing for your customers</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Generate customer gift cards that can be redeemed for rewards</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Unify sales data in one dashboard, making it easy to manage multiple stores from one place and export reports to CSV files</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Track and log employee hours to simplify payroll and keep vital employee records like pay rates and start dates</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Quickly create and assign tickets to track external and internal issues</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transaction fees:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Card-present transactions</strong>: 2.6% + 10¢ per sale</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Card-not-present transactions</strong>: 2.9% + 30¢ per sale</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4.
