This is to make sure that the products are automatically assigned to the collections you migrate to the target store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can easily do this manually with these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>First, create a CSV file of your products from the source store</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In the target store, go to the products tab and clickÂ <strong>Import</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Upload your CSV file and click on Import to finish the process</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>ðŸ’¡Read in detail:<a href=\"https://meetanshi.com/blog/import-products-to-shopify-using-csv/\">&nbsp;How to Import Products to Shopify Using CSV</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"export-collections\">Step 2: Export Collections from Source Store</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the source store from where you want to migrate collections, select the collection you want to export. Here, you can choose from Automated and Manually collections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Select the Shopify collection that youâ€™d like to export and click the&nbsp;<strong>Export</strong>&nbsp;button.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://meetanshi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/export-collections-source-store.png\" alt=\"export collections source store\" class=\"wp-image-36895\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>For manual collections, you also get an option to export collections with or without products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the export is done, the generated CSV file will be available for download. Go to the&nbsp;<strong>Import/Export history</strong>&nbsp;section and download the recently generated collections CSV file.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"import-collections\">Step 3: Import Collections into Another Store</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Navigate to the target Shopify store and navigate to the Meet Collections Import Export dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drag the collections CSV file you generated in the previous step into the&nbsp;<strong>Add file</strong>&nbsp;box and click&nbsp;<strong>Import.</strong></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://meetanshi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Import-Collections-into-Another-Store.png\" alt=\"import collections into another store\" class=\"wp-image-36895\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Once the Shopify Import Collections process is successful, a success message will be displayed.

You have successfully migrated product collections to Shopify. ðŸŽ‰</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Migrate Shopify Collections in Bulk?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You donâ€™t need to migrate each collection manually. The app supports bulk collections import-export option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the app dashboard, you can select multiple collections and generate a single CSV file. Then, import it into another Shopify store.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://meetanshi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/bulk-export-collections-in-a-few-clicks.png\" alt=\"bulk export collections in a few clicks\" class=\"wp-image-36895\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>This helps you save a lot of time that youâ€™d otherwise spend on manually creating product collections.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Migrate Shopify Collections in Seconds</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Migrating now shouldnâ€™t take you much time.
