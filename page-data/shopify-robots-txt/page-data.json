By customizing your robots.txt file in Shopify, you can set the rules to optimize your web pages’ visibility and improve your ranking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this blog you will learn everything about robots.txt file and how to make changes in robots.txt file in Shopify.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Shopify Robots.txt?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Robots.txt is a file that tells search engine crawlers or bots which pages to request from the website to list on Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to restrict access to certain web pages, you can mention them under the “disallow” tag in this text file. Also, if you like bots to crawl important pages of your site, you can update them in the “allow” tag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can check the robots.txt file for any website by visiting the route yourwebsite.com/robots.txt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shopify provides a default robots.txt file optimal for SEO for all Shopify stores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike in the old days, you can now edit robots.txt files in Shopify to customize them per your requirements. However, Shopify recommends that you only edit robots.txt files if you have knowledge of editing code and understand SEO requirements, as it can impact traffic on your store or block the domain altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Configure Robots.Txt in Shopify?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Shopify store themes are designed in liquid language, the robots.txt file template for Shopify is referred to as robots.txt.liquid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how you can add Shopify robots.txt to your online store and make changes in the file.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Editing theme.liquid file</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow the below steps to add the Shopify robots.txt file.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Open your Shopify admin portal and click <strong>Settings </strong>><strong> App and Sales channels</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>From the <strong>App and sales channels</strong> page, click <strong>Online Store</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Go to <strong>Open Sales Channels</strong> and click <strong>Themes</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You will find the <strong>Live theme section</strong>; click <strong>Actions </strong>> <strong>Edit code</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select <strong>Add a new template</strong>. You will find multiple template options here. Select <strong>robots</strong> from the list.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click <strong>Create a Template</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you create a template, you will get a default Shopify robot.txt.liquid template ready. It’s good to go for SEO purposes.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://meetanshi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Shopify-robot.txt-liquid-template.png\" alt=\"Shopify robot.txt liquid template \" class=\"wp-image-41553\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>However, you can update the code here if you wish to make any amendments.

You will add the conditions for which new rules will be applicable. If you want to update different bot settings for other search engines, you can also update them here. Use disallow expressions :\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>/blogs/*/tagged To disallow blog tag being crawled</li>\n\n\n\n<li>/collections/vendors*?*q= To disallow vendor collections from being crawled</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, * is any text input given by the user.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Remove a rule from existing rules: </strong>Although it’s not recommended practice from Shopify if you want to remove any existing rules from the default robots.txt.liquid file, you need to mention the code for the same accurately.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"generic\" data-enlighter-theme=\"\" data-enlighter-highlight=\"\" data-enlighter-linenumbers=\"\" data-enlighter-lineoffset=\"\" data-enlighter-title=\"\" data-enlighter-group=\"\">{% for rule in group.rules -%} {%- unless rule.directive == 'Disallow' and (rule.value == '/search' or rule.value == '/blogs') -%} {{ rule }} {%- endunless -%} {% endfor -%}</pre>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Add custom rules:</strong> If you want to add new rules that aren’t in the default group, you can update those changes at the bottom of the file template.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is Shopify robots.txt example for your reference –</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"generic\" data-enlighter-theme=\"\" data-enlighter-highlight=\"\" data-enlighter-linenumbers=\"\" data-enlighter-lineoffset=\"\" data-enlighter-title=\"\" data-enlighter-group=\"\">User-agent: *\n# Allow important pages\nAllow: /collections\nAllow: /products\nAllow: /blogs\n\n# Block irrelevant pages\nDisallow: /cart\nDisallow: /checkout\nDisallow: /admin\n\n# Block duplicate content\nDisallow: /collections/*?sort_by=\nDisallow: /collections/*?filter=\n\n# Sitemap location\nSitemap: https://www.yourshopifystore.com/sitemap.xml</pre>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Customize Robots.txt Using Third Party App</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you don’t want to get into the challenge of code-level editing for robots.txt file for your Shopify store, you can navigate to the Shopify app store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned earlier, you can check for robots.txt app. You can install it as per instructions, and update the links to specific pages and sitemap URLs.

You can navigate to the Google Search Console dashboard. Go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings &gt; Crawling &gt; robots.txt. Click Open Report</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From here, you can verify whether the robots.txt file is correctly implemented for your store or not.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://meetanshi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Test-Verify-Your-Shopify-Robots.txt-File.png\" alt=\"Test Verify Your Shopify Robots.txt File\" class=\"wp-image-41553\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>You can check the issues in this report and fix any errors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Best Practices for Configuring Robots.Txt File in Shopify</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Understand which website pages should be accessible to search engines to minimize the crawl budget for your online store.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use ‘Disallow’ directives to block access to the irrelevant pages of your store, like admin pages, checkout, cart, or any duplicate content.
