<p>Let’s discuss these factors in detail now:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="easeofuse">Ease of Use</h3>



<p>When it comes to ease of use, both Hyvä and Luma cater to different user needs effectively.</p>



<p>Hyvä is great for developers who are comfortable with modern web technologies like Apline.js and TailwindCSS. It offers a quick setup and easy customization process.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://meetanshi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ease-of-Use-Hyva.png" alt="Ease of Use Hyvä" class="wp-image-32502"/></figure></div>


<p>Luma, on the other hand, excels in its simplicity and accessibility. As the default Magento theme, it is pre-installed and ready to use, with minimal setup required. Luma’s intuitive navigation makes it easy to manage products, customize designs and adjust store settings.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://meetanshi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ease-of-Use-Luma.png" alt="Ease of Use Luma" class="wp-image-32502"/></figure></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="developerfriendliness">Developer Friendliness</h3>



<p>Hyvä is highly popular with developers due to its modern and efficient technologies. These tools make working with the theme easier and faster. Also, it’s not only the contemporary technology utilized by Hyvä that stands out, but also the pre-built components that enable rapid assembly of the frontend, saving time.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://meetanshi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Developer-Friendliness-Hyva.png" alt="Developer Friendliness Hyvä " class="wp-image-32502"/></figure></div>


<p>This minimal dependency approach of Hyvä reduces complexities, allowing developers to customize and extend the theme without dealing with any challenges associated with older frameworks.</p>



<p>In contrast, Luma is built on older technologies which can be difficult and less efficient for developers. These outdated frameworks can complicate the development process, making it challenging to achieve optimal performance and customization.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="technologystack">Technology Stack</h3>



<p>Hyvä leverages a modern technology stack. It uses Apline.js for its Javascript needs and Tailwind CSS for styling, both of which are lightweight highly efficient frameworks. These contemporary technologies ensure that it is well-equipped to meet current web development standards and deliver optimal performance.</p>



<p>Luma, in comparison, is built on technologies that are considered outdated and less efficient for modern web development. RequireJS, used for managing Javascript dependencies and KnockoutJS, a library for building responsive UI, both contribute to the complexity and slower performance of Luma.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="performance">Performance</h3>



<p>Hyvä is renowned for its exceptional performance again due to its lightweight and modern technologies. It reduces the overall complexity of the frontend, resulting in faster load times and improved responsiveness.</p>



<p>In addition to this, Hyvä’s streamlined codebase helps it achieve near-perfect Google PageSpeed score, making it an ideal choice for Magento 2 stores where speed and performance are of critical importance.</p>



<p>Luma struggles with performance issues because of its older technology stack. Users often experience slow response times and less efficient page rendering especially if a page contains a number of modules, which can negatively impact both user experience and SEO rankings.</p>



<p>Despite being functional and widely used, Luma’s performance lags behind Hyvä.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="seofriendliness">SEO-Friendliness</h3>



<p>Search engine’s prioritize fast loading times and Hyvä’s high-speed performance contributes to higher search rankings. Also, the clean and minimal codebase of Hyvä reduces the likelihood of technical SEO issues such as excessive HTML tags and slow server response times.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://meetanshi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SEO-Friendliness-hyva.png" alt="SEO Friendliness Hyvä" class="wp-image-32502"/></figure></div>


<p>Luma offers a decent level of SEO-friendliness but is hindered by its slow performance. While it includes basic SEO features like meta tags, sitemaps, and URL rewrites, its heavy reliance on various CSS and JavaScript files can slow down page load times. This can negatively impact search rankings as speed is a critical factor in SEO.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="customizationandflexibility">Customization and Flexibility</h3>



<p>Hyvä offers great customization and flexibility, making it a preferred choice for developers who need to create highly personalized and unique ecommerce experiences. It enables developers to easily modify styles, layouts, and functionalities to meet specific business needs.</p>



<p>Luma provides a basic level of customization and flexibility. It allows users to modify themes via the Magento admin panel and supports customization through CSS and JavaScript. While it offers sufficient options for standard customization needs, it is less flexible compared to Hyvä.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="integrationandcompatibility">Integration and Compatibility</h3>



<p>Hyvä, though offering modern and efficient solutions, faces some challenges regarding integration and compatibility. Some third- party Magento extensions might not be compatible with the theme. So, you might require additional development work to ensure smooth integration with existing systems and integrations.</p>



<p>Luma is great in integration and compatibility due to its status as the default Magento theme. It can work seamlessly with a wide range of&nbsp;<a href="https://meetanshi.com/magento-2-extensions.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magento extensions</a>&nbsp;and third-party modules. This extensive compatibility gives Luma an upper hand here.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricingandlicense">Pricing and License</h3>



<p>Hyvä requires a licensing fee. As of 2024, the licensing cost for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hyva.io/hyva-themes-license.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hyvä is €1,000</a>, which includes access to the Hyvä themes code as well as a year of support and updates. After the first year, a yearly subscription of €250 is required to continue receiving updates and support.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://meetanshi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pricing-and-License-hyva.png" alt="Pricing and License Hyvä" class="wp-image-32502"/></figure></div>


<p>Luma includes no additional cost with the Magento 2 installation. This makes Luma a cost-effective option for small businesses.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="customersupport">Customer Support</h3>



<p>Hyvä offers solid customer support through its growing community and dedicated resources. Users have access to a variety of support channels, including a dedicated Slack channel where they can interact with other developers, share ideas, and get help with their issues.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Also, Hyvä provides comprehensive documentation and tutorials, which are important for troubleshooting and optimizing the theme.</p>



<p>Luma also benefits from extensive support resources. As a widely used theme, it has a vast user base, which translates into a large pool of shared knowledge and community support.
